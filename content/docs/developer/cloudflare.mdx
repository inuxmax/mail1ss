Before you start, you must have a Cloudflare account and be hosted on Cloudflare.

## Overview

Administrators can manage domain configurations at `/admin/domains`, including adding, deleting, and modifying domains.

### Domain Configuration Form

The `Short URL Service` and `Email Service` require no additional configuration and can be activated to enable short URL and email functionalities (email requires worker forwarding setup).

To enable the `DNS Record Service`, you must complete the `Cloudflare Configs(Optional)` form with the following fields:

- Zone ID
- API Key
- Email

These fields are used to configure the Cloudflare API. If your domain is hosted through Cloudflare, you can find these details in the Cloudflare dashboard.

### Zone ID

The unique identifier for a domain hosted on Cloudflare, located at:

https://dash.cloudflare.com/[account_id]/[zone_name]

### API Key

Visit https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens, and find the **Global API** Key under the API Tokens section.

### Email

Email for registering a Cloudflare account

<Callout type="info">
You can manage domains hosted under different Cloudflare accounts, 
provided the API Key and Email are sourced from the same account.
</Callout>

# This section is Deprecated since version v0.6.0 

Before you start, you must have a Cloudflare account and be hosted on Cloudflare.

In this section, you can update these variables:

```js title=".env"
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE=[{"zone_id":"abc465","zone_name":"example.com"},{"zone_id":"abc465","zone_name":"example2.com"}]
CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL=user@example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_NAME=example.com,example2.com
```


## Variable Descriptions

### CLOUDFLARE_ZONE

- Description: A JSON array of objects, each containing a zone_id and zone_name for your Cloudflare zones. The zone_id is the unique identifier for a domain, and the zone_name is the domain name (e.g., example.com).
- Where to find: In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to your domain’s Overview section and locate the Zone ID.
- Example: `[{"zone_id":"abc465","zone_name":"example.com"},{"zone_id":"def789","zone_name":"example2.com"}]`
- Note: Ensure the zone_name values match the domains listed in NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_NAME.

> Instructions: Navigate to Cloudflare Dashboard, select your account, and find the Zone ID under the Overview tab of your domain.

### CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY

- Description: The API key used to authenticate requests to the Cloudflare API.
- Where to find: In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to Profile > API Tokens and locate your **Global API Key**.
- Example: 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
- Security Note: Keep this key confidential and never expose it in client-side code.

> Instructions: Visit https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens, and find the **Global API Key** under the API Tokens section.

### CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL

- Description: The email address associated with your Cloudflare account, used for API authentication alongside the API key.
- Example: `user@example.com`

### NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_NAME
- Description: A comma-separated list of domain names (e.g., `example.com,example2.com`) used for frontend display. These must correspond to the zone_name values in CLOUDFLARE_ZONE.
- Example: example.com,example2.com
- Note: Since this variable is prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_, it is exposed to the frontend. Ensure it only contains domain names and no sensitive information.

### Important Notes

- Correspondence: The zone_name in `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE` must match the domains listed in NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_NAME. For example, if CLOUDFLARE_ZONE includes `{"zone_id":"abc465","zone_name":"example.com"}`, then `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_NAME` should include example.com.
- Security: Never expose `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` or `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE` in frontend code, as they contain sensitive information. Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_NAME` is safe for frontend use.
- Validation: Ensure the zone_id and zone_name in `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE` are correct, as incorrect values will cause API requests to fail.

### Troubleshooting

- API Key Issues: If API requests fail, verify your `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` and `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` are correct and have the necessary permissions.
- Zone Mismatch: If the frontend displays incorrect domains, ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_NAME` matches the zone_name values in `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE`.
- Finding Zone ID: If you can’t locate your Zone ID, check the Overview tab of your domain in the Cloudflare dashboard.
